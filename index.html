    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>The Class</h3>
    <p>
      While registering for classes for the Spring 2018 semester, I noticed LAIS 376 (Service Learning).
      I remembered how much I enjoyed doing community service in high school and figured it be pretty cool
      to not only get back into it, but recieve easy college credit for it. I expected there would be some
      writing assignments here and there, but didn't think there'd be much beyond that. However, the course
      turned out to be much less manageable than I'd anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual community service project was the easy part. The difficulty came with keeping up with
      the copious amounts of reading and writing assignments. It would have been fine if the other three
      courses I'd stacked on top of it weren't all project oriented coding courses. But, that's my fault
      for biting off more than I could chew. I've always done things like that, getting overly ambitious.
      You think I would have learned my limits by now. In any case, this class did teach me a quite a bit
      about myself. It's taught my to be more flexible, more patient, and less impulsive. These three traits
      also happen to be in the

      chart discussed in the course.
