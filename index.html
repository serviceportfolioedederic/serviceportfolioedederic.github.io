    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>The Class</h3>
    <p>
      While registering for classes for the Spring 2018 semester, I noticed LAIS 376 (Service Learning).
      I remembered how much I enjoyed doing community service in high school and figured it be pretty cool
      to not only get back into it, but recieve easy college credit for it. I expected there would be some
      writing assignments here and there, but didn't think there'd be much beyond that. However, the course
      turned out to be much less manageable than I'd anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual community service project was the easy part. The difficulty came with keeping up with
      the copious amounts of reading and writing assignments. It would have been fine if the other three
      courses I'd stacked on top of it weren't all project oriented coding courses. But, that's my fault
      for biting off more than I could chew. I've always done things like that, getting overly ambitious.
      You think I would have learned my limits by now. In any case, this class did teach me a quite a bit
      about myself. It's taught my to be more flexible, more patient, and less impulsive. These three traits
      also happen to be in the
      <a href="http://www.habitsofmindinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/HabitsofTheMindChart.png">
        habits of the mind
      </a>
      chart discussed in the course. I also learned a lot about modern day issues. Many of these issues
      like gangs and racism, I was aware of, but I didn't realize the severity of.
    </p>

    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>
      The service project I'd decided to take on was volunteering as a tutor for the Reading Partners
      organization. For four hours a week, I would drive to Force Elementary School to tutor two kids
      that are behind in their reading in one-on-one sessions. The kids I was assigned to work with
      were a fourth grader and a first grader.
    </p>

    <h3>The Discussions</h3>
    <p>
      Many of our class discussions revolved around the concepts of poverty and privilege. We focused
      not only the many definitions of these concepts, but the many forms it can take. Types of poverty,
      white privilege, drug abuse, and disabilities are specific topics that struck a chord with me
      throughout the semester.

    <h2>Precious Service Experience</h2>
    <h3>Veteran Affairs Medical Center</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout high school, we were required to completed 30 hours or more of community service
      in order to graduate. You could also complete 100 + the last two digits of your graduating
      year (113 hours in my case) to be considered part of the "millenium club," which just got
      you an extra cord to wear during graduation. For those reasons, I ended up doing over 200
      hours of service at the Veteran Affairs Medical Center where my dad worked as an I.T. I
      was usually placed in the warehouse or in SPD (which is pretty much another warehouse, but
      for medical supplies). I spent my days during the summers filling supply orders, delivering
      supplies and packages to the departments throughout the hospital. I often filled orders so
      fast, that I would get the staff ahead of their work and we would just sit around listening
      to music. Since my tasks were all behind the scenes work, I didn't see much of the impact of the
      hospital's community, but it was still fulfilling to help get things done.
    </p>

    <h3>Locks of Love</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout middle school and high school I would grow out my hair and donate it to Locks of Love.
      Locks of Love was a non-profit organization that made wigs for children with cancer. It was an easy
      task that I didn't have to think much about. Every time my hair seemed long enough, I would just
      go to the salon to get it cut and donated. The thought of helping kids that were losing their hair
      to cancer treatment made me feel good. Until an investigation revealed that Locks of Love wasn't
      as non-profit as I thought. Apparently, they would charge the families of the cancer patients for
      the wigs. I felt betrayed at the time; I was donating my hair so that they could make a profit.
      I could have been dyeing my hair sooner or I could have been getting paid for giving my hair. Either
      way, I stopped donating my hair after that discovery.
    </p>

    <h3>Goodwill</h3>
    <p>
      My mother and I used to donate our old clothes to Goodwill on a regular basis. However, after it was
      made known to the public that the underpaid their disabled employees, we've refused to donate a single
      item. We have several disabled family members and it felt wrong to support an organization like that,
      especially when the CEO was making hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit.
    </p>

    <h3>Food Bank</h3>
    <p>
      Every now and then, my church will set up a service project with local food banks that help feed
      low income families. During these events, I'll go down to the food bank and help them sort out the
      food donations if I have the time.
    </p>

    <h3>National Honors Society</h3>
    <p>
      When I was accepted into the National Honors Society in high school, they required their members to
      complete 20 hours of service each semester. Luckily, they didn't just leave the members to figure
      out the where/when/what details. They provided several opportunities throughout the semester. these
      were all small projects such as manning a stopwatch at a swim meet, running a craft station at a
      Christmas party for an elementary school's after school tutoring program, and serving food to guests at a Christmas
      benefit concert. During the school canned food drives, I believe they even allowed you to substitute one
      donated can of food for fifteen minutes of service up to 5 hours worth of cans.
    </p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      In all of my past experiences in service, I was always doing work behind the scenes. I was never in
      any kind of direct contact with those I was helping. There was definitely a missing feeling of
      satisfaction that came with not seeing how the results affected people.
